# Miranda IM Sebijk Edition Configurator
Developed in the year 2007. Shipped with my customized version of Miranda IM. Miranda IM doesn't support the creation of preconfigured Profiles at the time (which was changed in Miranda NG). So the idea of the Configurator was born. Written in HTML and Visual Basic Script.
## Functions
* Create Profile
* Create portable Version of Miranda IM
* Backup & Restore Profile
## Installation
First clone this project, then put one of language vbs in the main folder and rename to language.vbs
